## üß† Models Implemented
The following algorithms are trained and evaluated:
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Neural Network (TensorFlow)**
  
## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing** ‚Äì class conversion, feature scaling
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis** ‚Äì visualization of feature distributions
3. **Train/Validation/Test Split** ‚Äì 60/20/20
4. **Model Training** ‚Äì each model trained on the same dataset
5. **Evaluation** ‚Äì confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy comparison

## üìà Results
The notebook contains:
- Visual comparison of feature distributions
- Accuracy metrics for each algorithm
- Confusion matrices and classification reports
- Discussion of which algorithm performed best
