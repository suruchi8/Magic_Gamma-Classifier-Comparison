🧠 Models Implemented

The following algorithms are trained and evaluated:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
Neural Network (TensorFlow)
🛠️ Workflow

Data Preprocessing – class conversion, feature scaling
Exploratory Data Analysis – visualization of feature distributions
Train/Validation/Test Split – 60/20/20
Model Training – each model trained on the same dataset
Evaluation – classification report and accuracy comparison
